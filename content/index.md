Crema Labs is a blockchain R&D studio created and maintained by [Yash](https://github.com/yash1io), [Ayman](https://github.com/nesopie), [Vikas](https://github.com/0xvikasrushi), and [Jayendra](https://github.com/jayendramadaram). We specialize in zero-knowledge proofs ZK, DeFi, and Bitcoin. Our mission is to push the boundaries of blockchain technology by developing cutting-edge solutions for the future of secure and scalable decentralized systems.

What Weâ€™re Working On:

1. [Web Proofs](https://hackmd.io/@immabeyeet/By3gIW690): Exploring the intersection of secure web content delivery and zero-knowledge proofs.
2. [App Attest](https://github.com/crema-labs/app-attest/blob/feat/certPathVerify/specs/appattest.md): Develop a zk-based attestation system that integrates with existing Apple Devices. 
3. Cryptographic Primitives: Building foundational libraries to remove limitations for the future projects and the broader blockchain community.
4. Bitcoin: Enhancing cross-chain interoperability with lightweight Bitcoin verification.

Stay tuned for updates on our research, developments, and open-source contributions!
